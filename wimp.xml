<p>Like many other RISC&nbsp;OS users, I started programming in BBC&nbsp;BASIC. Although it served me well, I began to find that it didn&rsquo;t always scale well &ndash; especially when software had to handle large, variable amounts of data or multiple documents.</p>

<p>After learning C on Unix systems, I began to investigate how it could be used on RISC&nbsp;OS. My first efforts directly copied the techniques used in BASIC, and quickly became just as unweildy as their predecessors.</p>

<p>Eventually I settled on using a combination of <link href="http://ro-oslib.sourceforge.net/">OSLib</link> and my own libraries &ndash; imaginatively called SFLib &ndash; based on it. Together, these have formed the basis of all of my software which has been started since 2000.</p>

<p>The aim of this guide is to give some help to those who are competent in C but have not used it when writing for the RISC&nbsp;OS desktop. It will also introduce the use of SFLib, which may be of interest to those writing Wimp software using OSLib.</p>

<p>Many thanks to all those on the <link href="https://www.riscosopen.org/forum/">ROOL Forums</link> who have answered my questions about the DDE and offered suggestions while I&rsquo;ve worked on this guide.</p>
