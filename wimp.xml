<para>For anyone familiar with writing in BASIC, the main polling loop is surprisingly simple.</para>

<code lang="c">/**
 * Wimp Poll loop.
 */

static void main_poll_loop(void)
{
	wimp_block	blk;
	wimp_event_no	reason;
	int		pollword;

	while (!main_quit_flag) {
		reason = wimp_poll(wimp_MASK_NULL, &amp;blk, &amp;pollword);

		/* Events are passed to Event Lib first; only if this fails to
		 * handle them do they get passed on to the switch statement.
		 */

		if (!event_process_event(reason, &amp;blk, pollword)) {
			switch (reason) {

			case wimp_OPEN_WINDOW_REQUEST:
				wimp_open_window(&amp;(blk.open));
				break;

			case wimp_CLOSE_WINDOW_REQUEST:
				wimp_close_window(blk.close.w);
				break;
			}
		}
	}
}</code>

<para>While main_quit_flag is FALSE, the loop repeatedly calls Wimp_Poll and passes the results on to event_process_event() so that Event Lib can do the hard work. It will look at the details in the poll block (such as target window handles or message types) and try to match the event up to one of the handler functions that have been registered with it; if this succeeds, the function will be called with the details in the block.</para>

<para>It's only if Event Lib fails to find anything to do with the information returned by the Wimp (in which case event_process_event() returns FALSE) that the poll loop needs to do anything itself. At present it just contains two &quot;handlers of last resort&quot; for Open_Window and Close_Window events: often these need little or no special handling, so providing generic code for them makes sense.</para>
