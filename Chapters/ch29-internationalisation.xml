<title>Internationalisation</title>

<summary>English isn&rsquo;t the first language of all RISC&nbsp;OS users, so how can we cater for those who would prefer to use our application in a different one?</summary>

<section>
<p>Whilst English appears to be the default language for most RISC&nbsp;OS applications, a significant number of users use a different one day to day. It would clearly be desirable to allow our application to translated for use in different languages, so that even if we can&rsquo;t do it ourselves, other people can provide translations if they wish to do so.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the system used by RISC&nbsp;OS for handling different languages dates back to the days of the BBC&nbsp;Master, and Acorn never really addressed the obvious problems with it. In addition, there was never an &lsquo;official&rsquo; way to handle different languages in an application, leading to developers each doing their own thing in the absence of any clear guidance.</p>

<p>The fundamental support for internationalising applications on RISC&nbsp;OS is provided by the International module, which allows a country, alphabet and keyboard layout to be configured for the system. However, setting the country also sets the default alphabet and keyboard layout, which immediately causes a potential problem should a user wish to type on a keyboard which isn&rsquo;t considered &lsquo;standard&rsquo; for their country.</p>

<p>In an attempt to address some of the issues, RISC&nbsp;OS&nbsp;3 introduced the Territory Manager. This attempted to extend the support to include dates, times and timezones, along with other information specific to a territory or region. There are routines for converting the case of letters, comparing strings and providing information about how to represent numbers.</p>
