Wimp Programming In C
=====================

A tutorial on writing RISC OS Wimp software in C.


Introduction
------------

Wimp Programming In C is a tutorial about writing multitasking RISC OS software (for the platform's Wimp environment) in the C language, with the help of OSLib.


Use
---

The tutorial was written with the single purpose of being published on <https://www.stevefryatt.org.uk/>, and is consequently in an XML-based format which can be parsed through [XML Docs](https://www.github.com/steve-fryatt/xml-docs) into a format suitable for the home-brew CMS used on that site. The format is largely semantic, however, so With some work on the parser's output module it shoould be possible to generate output in other formats as well.
